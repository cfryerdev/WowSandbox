# What is WunCraft?
WunCraft is a total frontend replacement for WoW Private Servers using the TrinityCore. It is made up on a nodejs backend api, and a react frontend. I saw a ton of php cms systems and handrolled php websites when doing my research... and I figured it would be a fun project to completely modernize it.  I am using React 16.4 / Node 8 / Bootstrap 4 / Font Awesome 5.

# Why are you building this?
Eh, seemed fun and a good challenge. Also, I dont really have an opinion on private servers.

# Where can I track progress on WunCraft?
You can track progress on my GitHub project board: [Board](https://github.com/cfryerdev/wuncraft/projects/1)

# When will it be done?
Who knows, When its done. I want to keep this project fun and stress free.

# How will I host it?
I plan on a couple of methods:
- Docker
- Heroku
- Your own host

# Where can I see WunCraft?
At the moment, [Demo on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/wuncraft)
